# Image-thresholding
Image thresholding is used to binaries the image, based on pixel intensities. The input to such thresholding 
algorithm is usually a grayscale image and a threshold. The output is a binary image. A problem with simple 
thresholding is that you have to manually specify the threshold value. We can manually check how good a 
threshold is by trying different values but it is tedious and it may break down in the real world. So, we need 
a way to automatically determine the threshold. The Otsuâ€™s technique named after its creator Nobuyuki 
Otsu is a good example of auto thresholding.

In this home-work you should implement Otsu algorithm by yourself and compare your result with any 
open source Tools. <br/>
